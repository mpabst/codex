variable cases:
L const, R var
  deref var
    unbound: bind ultimate - set as cp.var
    bound: equality check
  backtrack: unbind cp.trail
  deref: 

L var, R const
  cp.var || deref var
    bound: eq check
    unbound: bind ultimate, set as cp.var
  bt: unbind cp.trail

L var, R var
  deref
    both still vars: set L := R
    otherwise as above
